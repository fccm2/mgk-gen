The "META" file is un-tested.
The "find_install" target from "src/Makefile" is also un-tested.

Calling "magick_draw_info_set_compose", before "magick_image_draw"
doesn't seem to create any visible effect. [resolved]: got the answer at
IM/discuss that this is the expected result, the .compose field being there
only for the image primitive.  (thanks to Alan Gibson)
