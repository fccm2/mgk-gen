This package tries to provide an ocaml interface to the magick-core library
from image-magick.

If you're using "Crostini", you will maybe have to copy the file
"magick-baseconfig.h", from the directory "ImageMagick-6.9.11-60/magick/",
to the directory: "/usr/include/ImageMagick-6/magick/" (or any other source
compatible with the version of the magick-core you're using.)

To compile, try the command:
  $ make
